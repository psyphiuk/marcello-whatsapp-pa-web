# Debugging Signup Issue - FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

## The Problem
"null value in column 'email' of relation 'customers' violates not-null constraint"

## The Root Cause
In `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`, the customer insert was MISSING the email field!

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
.insert({
  id: authData.user.id,
  company_name: formData.companyName,
  phone_numbers: [formData.phoneNumber],
  plan: plan as 'basic' | 'pro',
  // EMAIL WAS MISSING!
})

// AFTER (FIXED):
.insert({
  id: authData.user.id,
  email: formData.email,  // <-- THIS WAS THE FIX!
  company_name: formData.companyName,
  phone_numbers: [formData.phoneNumber],
  plan: plan as 'basic' | 'pro',
})
```

## Testing Locally
